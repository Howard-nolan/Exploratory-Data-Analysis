# Exploratory Data Analysis

**Objectives:**
Exploratory Data Analysis is a standard process in the early stages of digital biomarker development. EDA allows us to explore relationships between variables in the data, examine trends, analyze missingness of data, and begin the process of understanding the link between the data and the physiological state we are studying.

**Input:**
.csv file with entire dataset. 

**Output:**
Figures for EDA (after filtering all the NULL data)

**Functions:**
This repository currently contains the following functions:
makehist: Plot histograms of all variables in data
makebox: Plot boxplot of all variables in data
makeleaf: Plot leafplot of all variables in data
makebubble: Plot bubble chart of all variables in data
makerun: Plot run chart of all variables in data
makemultivariate: Plot multivariate chart of all variables in data
makescatter: Plot scatterplot of all variables in data
